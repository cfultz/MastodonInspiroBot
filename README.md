# Mastodon InspiroBot

Inspired by this [@TheInspiroBot](https://twitter.com/theinspirobot) on the Bird site now on the Fediverse!

## What's it do?

Pretty simple: the bot toots a random inspirational quote hourly from [InspiroBot.me](https://inspirobot.me) to the Fediverse through my personal Mastodon instance [cfultz.com](https://cfultz.com).

## What's it need?

- Python3
- pip3
- json
- requests
- logging
- Inspiro
- Mastodon.py

## How do I make it work?

- Create a [bot account](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2018/08/easy-guide-to-building-mastodon-bots/) on a Mastodon instance ([botsin.space](https://botsin.space) is a good option)
- Place your application access token in *token.secret*
- ???
- Profit!

## What if that doesn't work?

It works for me. Sorry. Poke around and see what you may have missed. I tested it, it works.
